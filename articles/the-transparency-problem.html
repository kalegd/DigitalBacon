      <p>Transparent asset not showing what's behind it correctly? Let's dive into why that happens and how to fix it by updating the render order for different objects</p>

      <h3>Why things disappear behind transparent assets</h3>
      <p>To understand why, we need to learn about how rendering engines decide what to display</p>
      <p>To keep performance smooth and maintain high frame rates, rendering engines try to avoid unnecessary calculations. They skip over the parts of assets that are hidden behind others. The renderer only takes the geometry of an asset into account when seeing what should be skipped, not its material or transparency. You might think nothing would ever be displayed behind a transparent asset then right?</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the rendering engine renders all solid assets first. This ensures that a transparent asset won't block a solid one from being displayed. The issue is usually encountered among multiple transparent assets. To get around this, rendering engines oftentimes let you specify the <code>Render Order</code> for an asset. Assets with a higher render order won't prevent assets with a lower render order from being displayed</p>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Increase the render order of the transparent asset that is hiding other assets or decrease the render order for the asset(s) being hidden to solve the transparency problem. When using the <a href="/app">Digital Bacon Editor</a>, the Render Order attribute is typically found on the last page of an asset when editing via the virtual menu</p>
